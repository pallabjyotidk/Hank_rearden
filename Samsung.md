## Coding Round
1. An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order.
 Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear 
 before all positive numbers.

2. Given a Binary Tree where each node has positive and negative values.
  Convert this to a tree where each node contains the sum of the left and right sub trees in the original tree.
  The values of leaf nodes are changed to 0.

3) Given a binary tree. Find its maximum depth – minimum depth.

## Technical Round
1. Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once.
  (i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once).
  Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.

2. Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
  how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesn’t matter.
